**📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project**

Welcome to my Data Warehouse Project!

In this project, I built a modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and advanced reporting for business insights.

**📖 Project Overview**

This project includes:

**🧱 Data Architecture:** Designed using the Medallion Architecture – Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

**🔄 ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple source systems into the warehouse.

**📐 Data Modeling:** Creation of fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

**📈 Business Reports:**

**Product Report:** Segmentation and KPIs including revenue performance, customer reach, and product lifespan.

**Customer Report:** Behavior-based segmentation, lifecycle value, and activity timelines.

These reports are designed to support decision-making processes with clean, aggregated, and business-focused metrics.
